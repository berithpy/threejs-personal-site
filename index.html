      <h3>OCM/WEMADE - Jul 2019 -> Present </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Worked in a remote agile team developing a user CRM management system. Our work consisted in improving the
          user experience when handling and tracking client information and requests. For the frontend (NextJS, React,
          Apollo) we worked on creating a complete and mobile-first experience for users, focusing on simplicity. On the
          backend we worked with Gorm and GraphQL which made it easy and quick to expand on what the frontend needed
        </li>
        <li>
          Helped migrate data from legacy systems to stop using hard to interact with systems like ektron and siebel
        </li>
        <li>
          Helped develop and test a collection of serverless Go functions, called context-engine, to analyze and cleanup
          client spreadsheets and CSVs. This service provided our clients with cleaner and more insightful data about
          their target demographics.
